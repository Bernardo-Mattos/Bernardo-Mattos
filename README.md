## Work

Currently working in <a href="https://www.grupodva.com.br/">DVA - Group</a> as a Junior Developer, I've gained hands-on experience with Laravel. I've worked in any projects where I've:

- Developed and maintained web applications, following the MVC architecture pattern.
- Implemented RESTful APIs and integrated them with frontend frameworks.
- Utilized Eloquent ORM for efficient database interactions and performed database migrations.
- Ensured application security by implementing authentication and authorization features.
- Worked with Blade templating engine to create dynamic and reusable UI components.
- Collaborated with a team using Git for version control and participated in code reviews.

My experience with Laravel has strengthened my understanding of backend development, best practices, and the importance of clean, maintainable code. I'm continuously exploring new features and staying updated with the latest advancements in the Laravel ecosystem.
